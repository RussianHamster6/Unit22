We have an open night on Thursday evening, and a generally welcoming stance any other time, but we are careful to ensure that whilst the *space* is open to the public, the *tools* are largely off-limits.We host public workshops, which are supervised and are covered under our insurance.For members to get 24x7 access to the space, we operate a vouching process, where the trustees essentially get to know the new member directly or via other members reports. Once a trustee is happy that the new member is trustworthy, they are permitted to have keys and be on their own in the space.Some equipment in the space is off-limits to people that are not competent on that machinery. Typically we charge a fee for access to this specialist equipment (eg laser cutter, lathe, welding) to maintain a pot of money for maintenance and upgrades.

Since 1996 they’ve supported communities to get involved in creative activities, education and decision-making. Their activities range from after-school groups for young people exploring music and media, to environmental projects, talks and exhibitions. KWMC  has meeting, event and office space for hire, and undertakes professional creative commissions for clients. Project Manager - Business Advisor and Trainer specialising in supporting community based business initiatives.Creative Ideas Developer - Using their digital business expertise to ensure that we exploit digital technologies and thedigital skills and resources in the city to establish the innovativebusinesses of the future.They exploit the strengths in the city in digital innovation, and apply ideas to emerging business ideas from community projects., Company limited by guarantee, We wish to develop the pilot to become a more developed space under the branding of The Bristol Maker Lab (BML). This consisting of three distinct areas that provide a city wide benefit:This will be achieved by BML activity taking place every day throughout the year across two locations and as a schools and libraries programme: 1. BML Central - A city-centre location houses activities for individuals, artists, SMEs, and University and corporate teams, with easy access to smaller scale designing and prototyping, along with collaboration space and child care. Users pay for a membership package or take up a residency funded by other organisations.2. BML Factory - A South Bristol location, in Knowle West’s new Filwood Green Business Park (completion February 2015), provides a digital manufacturing floor that is a training ground for young people and adults who want to upskill. Many of the courses are funded allowing participants to gain both practical and life skills working on live com- missions with professionals.3. Maker Lab in a Box:SchoolsWith our mobile schools programme we will give children and young peoplepractical experience of digital manufacturing, enhancing their awareness of the possible careers of the future at a young age (Primary),and teaching them transferable skills foremployment (Secondary). This will begin in March 2015 with a year of experiments with six South Bristol schools. In three primary schools and three secondrary schools we are working with teachers, artists, technologists, pupils, trainees and apprentices to find creative and innovative ways of delivering the new ICT and computing curriculums and making technology more visible in schools.LibrariesWe are working with Bristol Libraries to help them respond in creative and sustainable ways to the changed environment of public spending cuts and the implications of new digital technology. In 2015 we will develop bespoke Maker Lab experiences to suit the needs of individual libraries, starting with the Central Library and continuingacross the city., We are meeting the challenge of aiming to allow community access for all to a maker space. This requires a different business model to other spaces we have researched.There has also been some issue around storage in the furniture project to allow larger scale production to take place. Along with adequate break out social space to coexist to ensure we maintain an environment enjoyable to all. We would also have to say that as many other spaces will testify that developing reliable sustainable income streams are always a challenge.Whilst the three distinct areas of delivery that we aim to reach have different target audiences that all present different opportunities and challenges., We have been networking and supported in our development by:Hackspace (Bristol) MAKLab GlasgowMakernow (Cornwall)Rusty Squid Ltd.
